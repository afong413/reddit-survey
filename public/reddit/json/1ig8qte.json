    "community": "This claim misrepresents the findings of fringe or methodologically flawed research and contradicts the overwhelming consensus in the scientific community. Major studies involving millions of children globally have found no credible link between vaccines and autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders. The post fails to cite the specific study or journal it refers to, making it difficult to assess the validity or peer-review status. Claims like this often rely on cherry-picked data or discredited sources. Parents should consult pediatricians and rely on guidance from reputable health organizations like the CDC and WHO.",
    "ai": "This post contains misleading information. Comprehensive analyses by institutions such as the Institute of Medicine and the CDC have found no causal relationship between vaccines and autism. The statistical figures mentioned (e.g., \"170% higher risk\") are not supported by reputable studies. Furthermore, many widely shared studies claiming such risks have been retracted or heavily criticized for flawed methodology. Without referencing a specific, peer-reviewed source, this post lacks credibility and promotes vaccine misinformation.",
    "expert": "This claim is false and based on scientifically discredited theories. No well-conducted, peer-reviewed study has demonstrated that vaccinated children have a higher risk of autism or other neurological conditions. The idea that vaccines cause autism originated from a 1998 paper that was later retracted for fraud. Extensive epidemiological research across multiple countries has shown no such link. Statements like these can contribute to vaccine hesitancy, posing real risks to public health by undermining confidence in life-saving immunizations."
