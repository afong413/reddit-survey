    "community": "This video has circulated online with claims of election fraud, but there is no verified evidence supporting those claims. The footage shows a worker appearing to mark or process ballots, but without context, it is unclear what is actually happening. Investigations into alleged fraud in Delaware County found no wrongdoing, and no charges were filed because no laws were broken. Election officials explained that workers may duplicate damaged ballots to ensure they are machine-readable, which is a standard and legal process under election law. Context matters in interpreting these videos.",
    "ai": "This claim is misleading. The video in question lacks context and does not show illegal activity. It depicts what is likely a common ballot duplication process where election workers transcribe votes from damaged or unreadable ballots to new ones, under bipartisan supervision. No credible evidence has emerged to indicate this footage represents voter fraud in Delaware County or elsewhere. Multiple audits and court reviews of the 2020 election—including in Pennsylvania—have confirmed the integrity of the results, with no widespread fraud found.",
    "expert": "False. The video has been previously reviewed in the wake of numerous election fraud allegations following the 2020 U.S. Presidential election. Experts and election officials confirmed that what’s shown is part of the legal process of ballot duplication, used when original ballots are damaged or cannot be read by tabulating machines. Pennsylvania law permits this procedure, and it is done under strict oversight. There have been no arrests or credible accusations tied to this footage because no illegal activity occurred. Claims suggesting otherwise are not supported by facts or evidence."
