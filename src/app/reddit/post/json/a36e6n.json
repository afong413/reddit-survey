    "community": "This chart misleads by emphasizing the proportion of human-generated CO₂ relative to the total atmosphere instead of focusing on the impact that CO₂ has on climate change. While it's true that CO₂ is a small percentage of the atmosphere, its effect on global temperature is significant. Climate scientists overwhelmingly agree that the increase in CO₂ due to human activities—mainly from burning fossil fuels—is the primary driver of recent global warming. Comparing the size of human-produced CO₂ to the entire atmosphere distracts from its actual warming effect.",
    "ai": "The image uses technically correct numbers but frames them to obscure scientific consensus. While human-produced CO₂ makes up a small fraction of the atmosphere, even small changes in CO₂ levels can dramatically impact Earth's energy balance. Since the Industrial Revolution, atmospheric CO₂ has risen from about 280 ppm to over 420 ppm, correlating directly with rising global temperatures. Climate models and observational data confirm that human emissions are the dominant cause of recent climate change.",
    "expert": "This chart is misleading in its framing. It focuses on the small percentage of CO₂ in the atmosphere and of human-caused emissions within that, which is irrelevant to CO₂’s powerful role as a greenhouse gas. Scientific evidence clearly shows that the accumulation of even small concentrations of CO₂ can trap heat and significantly alter climate systems. The argument resembles a common denialist tactic that confuses scale with effect. According to the IPCC and NASA, human activity is responsible for nearly all of the warming observed since the mid-20th century, making this post scientifically inaccurate."
