# Efficacy of Fact-Checking Sources on Reddit

This is the survey website used for my study "Efficacy of Fact-Checking Sources on Reddit." The publicly accessible pages are designed to be accessed from Prolific. The survey consists of 12 Reddit posts in 3 different categories—climate change, vaccines, and the U.S. elections. Each topic has 1 factually correct post and 3 at least partially misleading posts. For each participant of the survey, the question/post order is randomized. The false posts are possibly paired with a fact-checking alert that the participant is told is sourced from either the community, AI, or experts. The participants will rate each post's credibility on a 7-point scale. After question submission, all data is uploaded to a Supabase PostgreSQL database. After survey completion, participants are redirected back to prolific and marked as having completed the survey.
